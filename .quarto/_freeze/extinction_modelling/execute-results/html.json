Body size\n2.  Thermal tolerance\n3.  Speciality/generality of feeding or habitat preference\n4.  Growth rate\n5.  Productivity\n6.  Migration ability\n\nFocusing on one of these, thermal tolerance, we hypothesise that cooler species are being driven out from regions due to warming waters. Looking at @fig-edgar, we see that cooler species are generally declining in the southern parts of Australia, whilst warmer species are remaining consistent or increasing (in Tasmania at least).\n\n![Mean population trends for cool-temperate, warm-temperate and tropical species in six geographic regions around Australia over the last 10 years. Image from Edgar et al (Accepted for publication, 2023).](images/image-1610494163.png){#fig-edgar}\n\nThis leads to the question:\n\n**What happens to the cool-affinity species in Tasmania when the waters warm?**\n\n## The approach\n\n**1. It starts with an observation or idea:**\n\n\"*Has anyone noticed how we've started seeing a heap more tropical fish in our dives around Bicheno?*\".\n\n**2. Leading into a formal hypothesis or question:**\n\nWhat are the population trends of temperate and tropical fish species across Tassie in the past decade?\n\n**3. Thinking about how we might analyse this:**\n\nFor a single species, we could look at the abundance of each species over time - this could give us an idea about whether that species is going up, down, or remaining constant.\n\n![Back-of-envelope analysis of a single species population trend over time. Where a species may be increasing (orange), remaining constant (green), or declining (black).](images/Notes_230215_134427%20(5).jpg){#fig-scribble1}\n\nThe rate of decline in abundance over time, can give us an idea about how quickly the species is heading to 'extinction' (@fig-slopes).\n\n![Some species may decline more rapidly (species B) than others (species A). Is species B at greater risk of extinction?](images/image-2062724559.png){#fig-slopes}\n\n## Today's practical\n\nEdgar et al (Accepted, 2023) looked at the species trends for 1057 species. In this practical we will look at 20 of those species. The steps we will follow we be as follows:\n\n1.  Get general life history information about each species, e.g. mean or maximal body size of the species, thermal preference.\n2.  Getting fish abundance data from from the Reef Life Survey (RLS)\n3.  Use R to analyse and quantify population trends.\n\n### Step 1. Getting life-history data\n\nTry and get as much information about the species as possible. Sources include:\n\n1.  Fishbase\n2.  Wikipedia\n3.  IUCN\n4.  Reef Life survey\n5.  ChatGPT - ask for a reference/source and **check that source!**\n\nWe will split into pairs, each pair will try to get as much life-history information as possible. Input your data into the Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xS3Vvh5dRKqeGZlLSjoFXsAyfxCWRKPGD8YZylSfWw0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n### Step 2. Getting abundance data\n\n-   Check out https://www.reeflifesurvey.com, which will take you over to the AODN portal (@fig-aodn-screenshot):\n\n![Screen shot of the data extract we want](images/image-225441306.png){#fig-aodn-screenshot}\n\n### Step 3. Analysis in R\n\n-   Download R (<https://cran.r-project.org/>)\n\n-   Download R-Studio (<https://posit.co/downloads/>)\n\n-   Set-up a new project\n\n-   Read in data\n\n-   Fit a linear model of abundance as a function of time.\n\n#### Working in projects in R\n\n*TLDR; work in projects, your life will be easier.*\n\nThink of projects and a folder where you would keep all your input data, output figures, output summary data etc.\n\nWorking in projects makes your coding life much easier. R knows where to look for things, R knows where to output things, everything is organised, you will thank yourself later.\n\nSteps:\n\n-   Locate or create a file in your documents where you want to put all your R projects. For example I keep mine in \"Documents/Work/R_projects/\".\n\n-   Open R studio\n\n-   Create a new project, call it something useful, e.g. \"ksm718_extinction_prac\" or ksm718_prac2\", avoid using spaces or capitals, instead use \"\\_\".\n\nNote: When you open up the project in the future, just click on the .Rproj file, this will make sure your are actually working in that project. You can see which project you're working in at the top right of your Rstudio. See @fig-rproj.\n\n![Working in projects in Rstudio, here the project name is \"extinction_modelling\".](images/image-1928749062.png){#fig-rproj}\n\n#### Open a new script\n\n*TLDR; work in scripts, not in the console.*\n\nYou *can* code directly into the console, and it will work, but it won't keep track of all your code. Sometimes I code directly into the console if I just want a quick answer for something, e.g.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n5*(6/9)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3.333333\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen you write in scripts, you can \"send\" that code to the console to run, and you can save the script and come back to it later. Not only is that important for you personally working on big R projects, but its important when you come to publishing your code when you publish a paper.\n\nTo begin, write something in the R script, maybe start with a comment (use \"\\#\" to signifiy a comment - R will ignore any text after a hashtag), then save the R file.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# R script to analyse trends of species abundance\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Getting the data into R\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Edgar et al (Accepted, 2023), I have randomly selected 20 Tasmanian species. I have called this file is called \"count_data_20spp.csv\".\n\n##### Putting the raw data where R can access it\n\n**Create a new folder** in the project directory, you can either do that in R studio or you can actually locate the folder on your computer and create a new folder there. I am going to call this folder \"data\", you could call it anything that makes sense to you and your organisation, maybe you want to call it \"input\" or \"raw_data\". Basically this is to organise you files and keep all your data files together.\n\nHere we are only using a single data file, but it may be the case you have hundreds or thousands, and that's where this organisation will benefit you heaps.\n\nBecause we are working in projects, R already knows where to look (the location of the .Rproj file).\n\nFirst step is putting the raw data into the folder we just created (\"data\" or \"input\" or whatever you called it\".\n\nNow lets read in the data...\n\nR likes **comma separated value files (.csv)**, it does not like .xlsx files as in the back end of the file there's heaps of extra information that Excel uses and that R does not care about (e.g. colours of excel cells etc.). R just wants the raw data, nothing else.\n\n##### Coding\n\nThe first thing is normally do with a new script, is to load the `tidyverse` package. This package is actually a collection of packages, and is just a lot of code that has been developed to make coding in R much more friendly. It is the new approach to coding in R and its much better to learn 'the tidyverse way'. People talk about \"Base R\" vs \"the Tidyvese\", you will ultimately learn both. But start with the tidyverse.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# If you have not installed the tidyverse on your computer before, uncomment the line below and install it. You only need to do that once. You can remove it from your script after you've done that. \n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# once installed we can load the package\n# we need to do this every time we use any tidyverse code, so leave that line at the top of your scripts\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can read in the csv file using the tidyverse function called `read_csv()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# because I put the raw data into a folder called \"data\" I need to tell R to look in that folder for the file.\nread_csv(\"data/count_data_20spp.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 46950 Columns: 6\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): site_code, species_name\ndbl (4): latitude, longitude, year, count\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 46,950 x 6\n   site_code latitude longitude species_name    year   count\n   <chr>        <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>          <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 BI-S1        -41.9      148.

How we deal with NA values is an important thing to consider in the analysis, were there really zero individuals observed or where they not counted? In this dataset 0 values correspond to if a species has been previously observed at that site, and the site was surveyed and none were spotted, then it is a zero. NA values here correspond to the site not being surveyed in that year.\n\nFirst lets get rid of the years where the sites were not surveyed (NA values). We go from 49K rows to 14K rows, a lot more friendly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat_no_na <- \n  raw_dat |> \n  drop_na(count)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFirst thing before we start analyses, **plot the data!** Let's take one species, e.g. Aracana aurita.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 980 rows\ndat_one_spp <- \n  dat_no_na |> \n  filter(species_name == \"Aracana aurita\") |> \n  mutate(log_count = log(count))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are lots of rows, as each site has its own time-series. How about we look at the time series for each site in a big plot?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat_one_spp |> \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x = year, \n      y = log_count) + \n  geom_path()  +\n  # seperate the data into a window (facet) for each site_code \n  facet_wrap(~site_code, \n             scales = \"free_y\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](extinction_modelling_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSome time series are only two data points in length, probably not that informative, I would not be confident to say for example that the *Aracana aurita* is increasing at TAS174.\n\nOne way to overcome this is the take an average across the sites.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat_one_spp_mean <- \n  dat_one_spp |> \n  group_by(year) |> \n  summarise(count = mean(count))\n\n# average across all sites\ndat_one_spp_mean |> \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x = year, \n      y = count) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_path()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](extinction_modelling_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat is this species doing?
