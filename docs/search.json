    "text": "The vulnerability of a species to extinction is dependant upon many life history parameters, for example:\n\nBody size\nThermal tolerance\nSpeciality/generality of feeding or habitat preference\nGrowth rate\nProductivity rate\nMigration ability\n\nFocusing on one of these, thermal tolerance, we hypothesise that cooler species are being driven out from regions due to warming waters. Looking at Figure 1, we see that cooler species are generally declining in the southern parts of Australia, whilst warmer species are remaining consistent or increasing (in Tasmania at least).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mean population trends for cool-temperate, warm-temperate and tropical species in six geographic regions around Australia over the last 10 years. Image from Edgar et al (Accepted for publication, 2023).\n\n\nThis leads to the question:\nWhat happens to the cool-affinity species in Tasmania when the waters warm?"

    "text": "The approach\n1. It starts with an observation or idea:\n“Has anyone noticed how we’ve started seeing a heap more tropical fish in our dives around Bicheno?”.\n2. Leading into a formal hypothesis or question:\nWhat are the population trends of temperate and tropical fish species across Tassie in the past decade?\n3. Thinking about how we might analyse this:\nFor a single species, we could look at the abundance of each species over time - this could give us an idea about whether that species is going up, down, or remaining constant.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Back-of-envelope analysis of a single species population trend over time. Where a species may be increasing (orange), remaining constant (green), or declining (black).\n\n\nThe rate of decline in abundance over time, can give us an idea about how quickly the species is heading to ‘extinction’ (Figure 3).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Some species may decline more rapidly (species B) than others (species A). Is species B at greater risk of extinction?"

    "text": "Today’s practical\nEdgar et al (Accepted, 2023) looked at the species trends for 1057 species. In this practical we will look at 20 species. The steps we will follow we be as follows\n\nGet general life history information about each species, e.g. mean or maximal body size of the species, thermal preference.\nGetting fish abundance data from from the Reef Life Survey (RLS)\nUse R to analyse and quantify population trends.\n\n\nStep 1. Getting life-history data\nTry and get as much information about the species as possible. Sources include:\n\nFishbase\nWikipedia\nIUCN\nReef Life survey\nChatGPT - ask for a reference/source and check that source\n\nWe will split into pairs, each pair will try to get as much life-history information as possible. Input your data into the Google Doc here.\n\n\nStep 2. Getting abundance data\n\nCheck out https://www.reeflifesurvey.com, which will take you over to the AODN portal (Figure 4):\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Screen shot of the data extract we want\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Analysis in R\n\nDownload R\nDownload R-Studio\nSet-up a new project\nRead in data\nFit a linear model of abundance as a function of time."
